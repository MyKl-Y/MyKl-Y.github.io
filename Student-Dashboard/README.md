I want a computer science enthusiast dashboard with student info too. if i want to do the website (using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, maybe like node.js and express.js, maybe react, and mongodb with mongoose) some features I want are: 
1. an accurate time clock digital or analog doesn't matter
2. an accurate calendar where I can click a button that lets me input a certain task like an assignment or topic or something of sorts (this is not the only place where I can input tasks more on this later) where I can enter the course name it is for, type of task, date entered, start date, due date, last day i reviewed it, progress on it so far, my mastery on the topic, any notes or anything you can think of that will add a simplified version of to the calendar. maybe link with my apple calendar or google calendar
3. assignments table section (maybe separated based on courses) that I can do the same thing as the calendar and they share the same data however its just a table view with like filters, categories, and anything else. i can also check off if i have completed them. i also want the tasks to have a counter that shows days, hours, and minutes left before i need to complete them with also a status section that says if it is late, due, in progress, or good standing. access to my google sheets maybe?
4. A habit tracker where I can like input habits I want done and i can check them off as I do them a day and it repeats everyday for a certain amount of time of my choosing. has a streak counter that can update to my calendar that says idk something like "Tasks Complete" or something
5. like a courses dashboard where i can like input courses into like cards, separated by school years, where they have like an image the course name and number, if it is inprogress or completed, and if it is clicked i want it to popup a modal with said info and more like professor and their contact, the main website, the textbook website, syllabus, and assignments for this class entered based on the previous features but also i can add assignments from here
6. a review tab/section where it can take in all the information i have given so far like when I was supposed to learn something, last time I reviewed it, and other information of sorts and tell me what to review 
7. an initial homepage custom for me obviously
8. a notes tab where i can enter in notes (maybe advanced) where it can have like styled text that i can change while using the app, tables, images, code snippets etc. maybe access to my notion and google docs if it is an app or website
9. resources tab like books or websites i found useful or helpful
10. link to my portfolio website, github, other websites, and other socials, etc
11. internship/job section (either table format or cards) where i can input like internships or jobs that i have applied to that has the website for the specific role, the role, when i applied, statis (like regected, interviewing, accepted, etc) and anything else of importance
12. show my gpa, credit hours, university, current major, type of degree, resume, etc.
13. i want to be able to (either in sheets format or list format or maybe even a roadmap format) create an extensive list of sorts that i can input all of the required courses I need to graduate depending a major i choose showing the a part where i can check off the classes i have taken, course id, course name, number of credit hours, the thread (thread is a subsection of a major) it is a part of, its section (a section is a class type section like Core E - social sciences for example) it is a part of, if i have completed the requirements for a section (some sections have multiple options but onlu need like 1 or 2 of the classes or a certain amount of credit hours to complete), if i have the corequisite and prerequisites to take a class, a link for the course description, etc. i also want to see like my total credit hours and if i am on track to graduate
